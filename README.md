A Frontend software developer & UI/UX Designer based in Nairobi, Kenya. I love solving problems and creating cool stuff with code. I also do graphical designs during my spare time.

- 🌱 If you want to begin the journey of a web/application developer , I would recommend this course on [UDEMY](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

- 📝 I’m looking to collaborate on Frontend or UI design projects.
- 📫 Reach out: [@andrewochieng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-ochieng-00b076180/) or email at andrewomosh44@gmail.com

- We run a startup company with a few friends. It would be kind to talk to you on how we can collaborate together to make the world a better place.


  ✨ HAPPY CODING!! ✨
